# WhatsApp Reader 2.0

## Rules for chat files to be imported
- groups or contacts can't have the name '_SYSTEM'
- groups or contacts can't contain a colon (:)
- system notifications (e.g. change of group description) can't contain a colon  
*should not be the case anyway, but check if import fails*

## Limits
- if you've left a chat, message is not recognized as a system notification

## Planned features
- chat statistics
- notification when chat with same name was already imported
- language agnostic chat import (currently only german)
